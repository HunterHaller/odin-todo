# odin-todo
To-do list project as [assigned](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

This took a while to finish but I'm putting it out at last! Lots of stuff covered on this one, including but not limited to more use of factory functions, an introduction (or rather a re-introduction) to local storage use, and OOP principles.

As usual, the hardest part honestly felt like styling, and that's a weak point on many practice projects I've made over the years. It's no masterpiece, but I did take more focused time on the appearance on this one and I think it is a solid "okay".

That's all for now, might add more to this write-up later. On to the next lessons!
